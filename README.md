## Project discontiued
As of 5th September 2016, this project is discontinued due to rate limiting enforced by the HIBP API, which this tool entirely relies on. The tool would need some tweaks to respect the limit 1 API request per second, but it would be difficult to run in a cloud environment with set execution time as originally intended. Feel free to modify it, it's in JS, so it shouldn't be that hard to just rewrite request function for browser usage.

UPDATE 1.1
When I've first published this tool, I hoped for greater good. I've hoped, that computer savvy people could inform their friends, average Joes, that their password has been leaked and that they should change it. To achieve this I've included this idea in message appended to every result email.
In light of recent breaches I've decided to add monitoring to the script. It is a compromise between deleting this tool and letting anyone uncontrollably search for potential blackmail.
